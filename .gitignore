This is awesome. Thanksyou. You can also get a good gitignore file by using the Team Explorer view in Visual Studio. Go to the repo, go to settings, and if you do not have a .gitignore already, you can create one which looks similar to this gist.

I guess Im messing up somewhere but this is ignoring system files and breaks the whole project, for example all dll's in /bin folder which are the core of the project system files.

@gtusar
gtusar commented on 16 Oct
Does not the second *.dll (line 72) and packages (line 68) under # OS generated files # override whole this section (lines 12-16):

# Include dlls if they‚Äôre in the NuGet packages directory
!/packages/*/lib/*.dll
!/packages/*/lib/*/*.dll
# Include dlls if they're in the CommonReferences directory
!*CommonReferences/*.dll
?
